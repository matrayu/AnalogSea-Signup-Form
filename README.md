The Scenario: AnalogSea Signup Form
You're freelancing for a cloud computing startup called AnalogSea. The task for today is to code up the first version (aka, v1) of a simple account creation page based on the designs below. For v1, the client wants clean, SEO- and accessibility-friendly HTML. They're providing you with a design file and a list of requirements for the form, and by end of day, you need to deliver a live version of the page they can preview.

Requirements
You are building a signup page as represented in the designs found below this list of requirements.

Respect any widths and heights indicated in the annotated design file.

AnalogSea's logo appears at the top of the page. Reference it from here by right/Ctrl-clicking the logo and choosing "Copy Image Location":


The form should post to the URL /signup/ when the user submits it.

The email and password fields are both required.

The form should validate the email field for a valid email address.

The login link should point to /login.

The logo and form should be horizontally centered. The logo should have a height of 35px, as indicated in the design. Although the source file has a height of 111px, use CSS to set its height to 35px.

The logo should also have a helpful alt attribute to comply with accessibility best practices.

Stretch feature: When the user hovers over the submit button, it should transition to a darker shade of green.

The page should be SEO- and accessibility-friendly. That means including a title and description in the head of the document and using the best HTML possible. Research <input> and <button> elements, and remember to use labels with their for attributes set appropriately.

Utilize the DevTools inspector! If you don't understand why an element is behaving the way it is while you're designing, open up DevTools and see if your browser is applying some default styles, then figure out how to override them.

Use repl.it to create your work, periodically running it as you go to test your progress.
